## Getting Started

Note: Signal Applications requires an Event store Module

Creating a Signal Application is as simple as

```elixir
defmodule App.Signal do
    use Signal.Application,
        store: EventStore 
end
```

Then next step is adding the application as part of your 
Application supervision tree

Note: Ensure your Event Store must be started before your application

```elixir
defmodule App.Application do
    use Application

    def start(_, ) do
        children = [
            ...
            App.Signal,
            ...
        ]
        Supervisor.start_link(children, [...])
    end

end
```

### Dispatch

#### dispatch/2

Once the command has been registered in a [router](router.md) a command can be dispatched using the signal application

```elixir
    alias Signal.Result
    alias App.Bank.Commands.Deposite

    with {:ok, %Result{}} <- App.Signal.dispatch(%Deposite{}) do
        ...
    end
```

Getting the result aggregate state after all the command events have been reduced
```elixir
    alias Signal.Result
    alias App.Bank.Commands.Deposite

    with {:ok, %Result{states: states, events: events}} <- App.Signal.dispatch(%Deposite{}, await: true) do
        ...
    end
```

The %Signal.Result{} struct holds all the events generated by the command and the aggregate states if await is `true`
